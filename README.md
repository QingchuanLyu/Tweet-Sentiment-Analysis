# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
Given a dataset of tweets and their sentiments (positive, negative or neutral), predict what part of each tweet imply its sentiment. Training data (3.34 MB) was from Kaggle. I attacked this problem with three methods: Name Entity Recognization, Question-Answering System and Roberta Inference. My jaccard similarity score was 0.715 with Roberta, measured by unseen test data. A potential improvement would be a meta model combining these models together.
